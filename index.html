        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          👋 I am yet another FAF student who enjoys being part of this world
          where the technology keeps flourishing by each day. Also, I am into
          OOP, FOSS, Linux, Web Development, and I really enjoy watching/reading
          about tech/coding related content, while sipping from my cup of warm
          seaberry tea. As importantly, I aspire to work as a chill
          back-end/full-stack engineer, while tinkering with my personal
          homelab, as a hobby.
